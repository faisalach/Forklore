### Topic and Motivation:
Our project to recommend nutritious food that is good for health because of the large number of stunting cases in Indonesia. This project uses Content Based Filtering.

### Target User Group:
Our target is families and individuals who care about the problem of stunting in Indonesia, especially those who have children who are still small or are still growing. Those who do may have specific concerns about proper nutrition to support their children's growth and development.

### Proposed Solution:
First, collect data on foods, nutrition, and user preferences. After preprocessing the data to clean and organize it, develop Machine Learning models using algorithms such as Collaborative Filtering or Content-Based Filtering. Model validation is important to ensure accuracy before integrating it into user-accessible platforms. Finally, monitor and update the model periodically to maintain the quality of recommendations.

### Product Branding:
Forklore is an application that becomes a loyal companion in your journey towards a healthy life. Built with a focus on addressing stunting issues in Indonesia, Forklore presents nutritious food recommendations tailored to your needs. With advanced technology and guidance from the Quran and Hadith, Forklore helps you choose the right foods for optimal growth and good health.

### How This Project Relates to SDGs:
The collaboration between Forklore and the halal certification program at UIN Bandung promotes holistic health and facilitates users in accessing foods that align with nutritional and Islamic principles. This synergy supports a healthy and sustainable lifestyle, providing significant benefits to the community as a whole.
